# TEG Sense Board

This is a thermoelectric generator (TEG) boost converter used to power a connected battery or capacitor to periodically operate a microcontroller reading from a biometric sensor to compute blood oxygen saturation. That was a big sentence!

This is the second iteration which fixes some bugs in the first and is meant to be used on a FlexPCB, including bigger connectors to make printing conductive traces onto the terminals easier.
